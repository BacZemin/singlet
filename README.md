# singlet v.0.0.99

Singlet is an R toolkit for single-cell data analysis using non-negative matrix factorization.

## Dimensional Reduction with NMF

## Integration with Linked NMF

## Ongoing Work

Singlet is being actively developed, thanks to funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub:

* A new single-cell data class that uses 10x less memory than SCE or Seurat (and much faster)
* Full support for Seurat and SingleCellExperiment classes
* Out-of-core dimensional reduction with NMF
* Regularization and weighting to enable discovery of robust transcriptional signatures with NMF
* Spatially-aware dimensional reduction
* Extremely fast divisive clustering
